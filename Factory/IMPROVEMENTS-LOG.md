# App-improvement loop — research → revise → repeat

An autonomous, self-paced loop (peer authority) that keeps improving the app. Each iteration:
**research/pick the highest-leverage item → revise (build it) → verify (real gate + build + live) →
commit → log here → schedule the next.** Self-correcting: every iteration reads this ledger, updates
the backlog from what it learns, and stops scheduling when the backlog runs dry of high-value items.

Verification bar (every shipped change): `npm test` green · `npm run build` clean · walked live in the
browser (the critic's lesson: an automated gate keeps passing prose/pixel divergence — eyeball it).

## ⭐ DIRECTION (2026-06-25, from Sky): CURRICULUM EXPANSION — breadth now, not refinement
Sky redirected: "i wanted another topic. break up the current lessons into more, and fill in the rest.
look online for how you should structure it." A 4-lens web-research workflow (35 sources) produced a
**15-lesson structure in 6 modules** (proposal in the wf result / synthesized below). Sky chose
**content-first** ("go ahead and i will tell you if anything is wrong"). Keep exposure as ONE lesson;
skip prose-y RAW/critique (no sim). **Progress:**
1. ✅ **Shutter speed & motion** — DONE (d77c6d3), L3. Added goal-aware MotionView caption; derived `number`.
2. ✅ **Composition: balance & negative space** — DONE (acd78b5), L7. Split from rule-of-thirds; added
   `balance`/`negativespace`/`composefree` compose targets + a fixed-anchor render.
3. ❌ **When the meter is fooled** — SKIPPED: metering already covers snow-fools-the-meter (beat 6) +
   backlit dynamic range (beat 5); a separate lesson would duplicate it (the thin-split Sky warns against).
   If wanted later, fold ONE "night reads grey → compensate DOWN" beat into the metering lesson instead.
4. ✅ **Flash: adding your own light** — DONE (82ee257), L9. Added a `fill` dimension to the LightDirection
   sim (opens harsh shadows; full fill → flat). Distinct from L8 (natural light). [expansion 3]
5. **Focus & the focus point** — NEXT candidate, but ⚠️ needs a focusable subject with a clear focus PLANE;
   DofBokeh is flower-only (no face/eye). Either add a focus-point tap to DofBokeh (focus subject vs bg) or build a small sim.
6. **Portrait (genre capstone)** — ⚠️ sim-coherence (combine aperture+light+focus into one artifact).
7. **Landscape (genre capstone)** — ⚠️ recombines but each beat jumps sim / overlaps; needs design.
8. **Focal length & perspective** — major compression sim.

**⚠️ KEY FINDING (2026-06-25): the cheap content-recombination wins (#1, #2) are DONE; everything left
needs NEW SIM WORK, not just content.** Next move is a SIM decision, not another quick lesson:
- **Focus & focus-point** — tap-to-focus, but needs a face/eye subject (DofBokeh is flower-only).
- **Flash** — a flash source + ambient slider on LightDirection (read `src/sim/LightDirection.jsx` first).
- **Focal length & perspective** — a major compression/dolly-zoom sim.
- **Genre capstones (Portrait/Landscape)** — sims are scene-specific, so one coherent portrait/landscape
  artifact across aperture+light+compose isn't free. Pick: build a dedicated genre sim, or accept multi-sim beats.
Read `src/sim/DofBokeh.jsx` + `src/sim/LightDirection.jsx` before picking the next sim to build.

## Deferred (lower priority than the curriculum breadth Sky asked for)
- **Second BET** (L3 snow-histogram ghost-tick) — the `bet` kind is proven; revisit after breadth.
- **WB Kelvin reads backwards** (truth debt, iter-#4 critic): `wbResultK` beats 3 & 5 show warmer→LOWER
  K (inverse of real cameras). Beat 1 sidesteps it (Kelvin dropped). Flip the sign or demote per shift #6.
- **Free-play Studio** — locked north-star deliverable; larger build.

## Parked (need new engine capability — don't ship until built)
- **silhouettes** — REJECTED as L9 (iter #3). The `backlit` scene's tree↔sky separation (~2.3 stops) is
  too small for a true silhouette: engine sweep showed NO exposure makes the tree black (<25) while the
  sky stays bright (>150). Needs a dedicated high-contrast scene (bright sky ~250, subject ~10) — then the
  factory's design (expose-for-background + profile rank + rim) becomes shippable and distinct from L3.

## Watch / debt
- **ISO-on-night appears in L1, L7, L8.** Each teaches a distinct facet (ISO-as-brightness-lever /
  ISO-as-impatient-alternative-to-time / ISO-noise-discipline), like exposure recurs across lessons — but
  if it ever reads as repetitive, consolidate or vary the scene. Note before adding a 4th.
- **BET primitive a11y (periphery — do after core).** The phase 1→2 lock transition isn't announced to a
  screen reader (no focus move / aria-live); a blind learner can't perceive the cast they're betting
  against beyond the predict slider's relative valueText. Real exclusion, but core-substance first.
- **`WB_BET_MSG` copy is WB-specific** (hardcodes orange/blue). Generalize the bet primitive's message
  layer when a 2nd bet lands on a non-WB beat.

## Iterations
### #1 — 2026-06-25 — shipped L7 "Long exposure: painting with time"  ✓ (commit dbc6725)
Took the lesson factory's strongest candidate, fixed BEAT 3 (brightness band so overshoot fails),
integrated as L7. Real gate 81/81, build clean, beat-0 glow confirmed live. The factory's correctness
loop guaranteed buildable; its quality loop (critic) caught the prose/pixel bugs the gate is blind to —
exactly why a human-verified last mile matters. Next: iso-and-noise → L8.

### #2 — 2026-06-25 — shipped L8 "ISO & noise: the price of light"  ✓ (commit 7c1f87d)
Took the factory's iso-and-noise candidate. Grounded the truth claims in the engine (node sweep), which
both confirmed ETTR (shadow grain Δ 54→22 as capture exposure rises) AND exposed a real miscalibration:
BEAT 6's keeper copied the night's `>=1600` floor onto the BRIGHTER room, which actually reads at ISO 800
— so the right answer would have been wrongly rejected. Fixed it to 800 (better transfer: the scene sets
the floor) and tightened BEAT 3 to the exact floor (1600). Real gate 90/90, build clean, both claims
confirmed live (grain blizzard at max ISO; shadows lift + de-noise on expose-to-the-right). Course now
8 lessons. Next: silhouettes → L9 (unblocked by the new backlit tree subject).

### #5 — 2026-06-25 — DIRECTION PIVOT to curriculum expansion; shipped "Shutter speed & motion" (L3)  ✓ (commit d77c6d3)
Sky redirected from refinement (iter #4) to BREADTH — more topics, broken-up + gap-filled (see DIRECTION
above). Researched the structure online (35 sources, 4 lenses) → a 15-lesson / 6-module plan; Sky chose
content-first. Built lesson #1 of 5: **Shutter speed & motion** — shutter as a creative axis (lead with
blur=speed → confirm → freeze → rank subjects by shutter → commit-keeper). Reused the motion sim; made its
success caption goal-aware so a blur-goal beat greens (was freeze-only). Made lesson `number` derive from
position so inserts don't need renumbering. Gate 99/99, build clean, full live walk both widths, no errors.
Distinct from L1's freeze beat + L7 long-exposure. Next: Composition II → meter-fooled → portrait → landscape.

### #4 — 2026-06-25 — shipped the BET primitive (predict → be-wrong) on WB beat 1  ✓ (commits 614e623, 7ca7722)
The blueprint's #1 highest-ROI shift: a committed, falsifiable prediction before the reveal. New engine
step kind `bet` (SEE → BET → BE WRONG): predict on a frozen photo → lock → the bet pins as a ghost tick
and the live slider reveals how far PAST it neutral really sits. Engine-proved the bet fires first (at the
intuitive center, R/B gain 1.48 → orange; neutral at −0.6). Gate + build + full live walk (both widths).
**Then ran a 4-lens adversarial Sky-critic — it earned its keep**, finding a TRUTH BLOCKER + 4 majors I'd
missed, all fixed in 7ca7722 + re-verified live:
- Kelvin readout ran BACKWARDS from every real camera (warmer→lower K) → dropped the number; the felt
  caption carries it (blueprint shift #6). [logged the systemic beats-3/5 version as backlog #2]
- Success copy validated a WRONG-DIRECTION bet as "right instinct" (the blueprint's #1 named risk) →
  replaced with a pure, **gate-tested** classifier (center/wrong/near/short/over) so it can't regress.
- Scene seascape read teal-grey under the "too orange" cast (a lie) → switched to **snow** (orange under
  cast R-B=63, clean white when corrected R-B=−12 — truthful both ways). Portrait (the critic's pick) was
  rejected in-engine: intrinsic R-B=47, so "neutral" still looked warm. Verify-the-claim paid off again.
- Bet wasn't a real commitment (lock always enabled) → disabled until the marker is dragged.
- Ghost tick mis-tracked the 28px thumb (the gap it shows is the lesson) → inset-track calc.
LESSON (reinforces the meta-rule): the live walk + engine sweep are load-bearing, but the **adversarial
critic catches the truth/pedagogy class the gate and a single builder miss** — run it every build, then
fix-forward. Next: a 2nd BET (L3 snow-histogram) or the WB Kelvin truth-fix.

### #3 — 2026-06-25 — REJECTED silhouettes; shipped cold-start onboarding  ✓ (commit 66d9d59)
Verified silhouettes in-engine before trusting it: no exposure on the `backlit` scene yields a black
tree (<25) against a bright sky (>150) — they never co-occur — so the lesson's central claim is a
prose/pixel divergence; plus its exposure spine overlaps L3. Rejected + parked (needs a dedicated
high-contrast scene). Pivoted to the next backlog item: **cold-start onboarding** — an unguarded /try
route lets a visitor play Lesson 1 with no account (store persistence already no-ops without a user),
asking for the account only at the end. Verified live: logged-out /try renders Lesson 1, guarded routes
still gate. Gate 90/90, build clean. The loops + an engine check kept a plausible-but-false lesson out.
Next: the pedagogy BET slice (a predict-with-a-commit ghost-tick) — the highest-leverage item left.
